3.2.1 (2018-10-15)
------------------

- The default initializeVector is now a byte string.


3.2.0 (2017-05-16)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6.


3.1.1 (2017-04-19)
------------------

- Removed all version constraints from buildout.cfg, since the app
  works fine with all the latest versions.


3.1.0 (2016-04-22)
------------------

- Add an implementation of encrypt_file and decrypt_file.
  This allows chunked encoding and decoding of files.

3.0.1 (2016-04-05)
------------------

- Bumped the setuptools version in buildout.cfg.


3.0.0 (2014-01-06)
------------------

- Switched from `M2Crypto` to `PyCrypto`, since `M2Crypto` is not maintained
  anymore.

- Switched from deprecated `repoze.bfg` to `pyramid`.

NOTE: While I found code online to make the switch from `PyCrypto` to
`M2Crypto` backwards compatible, I have not tested that functionality. Please
try this on your data and let me know if you have issues.

NOTE 2: `PyCrypto` does not allow 512-bit RSA keys, so I increased the key
size to 2048 bits. Old 512-bit keys should still work, but new ones will be
always larger now.


2.1.0 (2010-10-07)
------------------

- Added a cache for unencrypted DEKs in the key management facility, like it
  was already done for the local key management facility. This increases
  encryption and decryption performance by an order of magnitude from roughly
  2ms to 0.2ms.

2.0.0 (2010-09-29)
------------------

- Refactored REST server to be a simple repoze.bfg application.

- The encrypted data encrypting keys (DEKs) are now stored in a directory
  instead of the ZODB. This increases transparency in the data store and makes
  backups easier.

- Added caching to directory-based facility, so we do not need to read files
  all the time.

1.1.1 (2010-08-27)
------------------

- Fixed deprecation warnings about md5 and zope.testing.doctest.

1.1.0 (2010-08-25)
------------------

- Feature: Updated code to work with Bluebream 1.0b3.

1.0.0 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Feature: Update to the latest package versions.


0.3.1 (2008-09-11)
------------------

- Relax M2Crypto version requirements to 0.18 or newer.


0.3.0 (2008-09-04)
------------------

- A simple KeyHolder utility is available in keas.kmi.keyholder.


0.2.0 (2008-09-04)
------------------

- Sample server shows how to enable SSL

- Front page now shows the number of stored keys instead of a
  ComponentLookupError message.

- Command-line client for testing a remote Key Management Server

- Bugfix: LocalKeyManagementFacility was broken (AttributeError: 'RESTClient'
  object has no attribute 'POST')


0.1.0 (2008-09-03)
------------------

- Initial Release

  * Key Generation Service

  * Encryption Service (Master and Local)

  * REST API for key communication between encryption services

  * Encrypted Persistent Storage
