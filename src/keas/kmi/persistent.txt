Encrypted Persistent Objects
============================

This package provides an `EncryptedPersistent` class that takes care of data
encryption in the storage.  Usage is pretty simple: instead of subclassing
`persistent.Persistent`, subclass `keas.kmi.persistent.EncryptedPersistent`:

    >>> from keas.kmi.persistent import EncryptedPersistent
    >>> class UserPrivateData(EncryptedPersistent):
    ...     def __init__(self, name, ssn):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.ssn = ssn
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return '<UserPrivateData %s %s>' % (self.name, self.ssn)

    >>> userdata = UserPrivateData('Stephan Richter', '123456789')
    >>> userdata
    <UserPrivateData Stephan Richter 123456789>

The key used for encryption and decryption comes from an IKeyHolder utility
that you're supposed to provide in your application.

    >>> from keas.kmi.testing import TestingKeyHolder
    >>> from zope.component import provideUtility
    >>> provideUtility(TestingKeyHolder())

None of the raw data appears in the pickle

    >>> from zodbpickle import pickle
    >>> pickled_data = pickle.dumps(userdata)
    >>> b'Stephan' in pickled_data
    False
    >>> b'123456789' in pickled_data
    False

We can successfully load it

    >>> pickle.loads(pickled_data)
    <UserPrivateData Stephan Richter 123456789>

Every persistent object is stored separately.  Only the objects that inherit
from `EncryptedPersistent` will be encrypted.

    >>> import persistent.dict
    >>> users = persistent.dict.PersistentDict()
    >>> users['stephan'] = UserPrivateData('Stephan Richter', '123456789')
    >>> users['mgedmin'] = UserPrivateData('Marius Gedminas', '987654321')

    >>> pickled_data = pickle.dumps(users)
    >>> b'stephan' in pickled_data
    True
    >>> b'123456789' in pickled_data
    False


Persistent References
---------------------

Enough pickling; we really should make sure our magic does not interfere
with ZODB keeping track of persistent object references.

First let's make our `EncryptedPersistent` objects have some references to
other (encrypted and unencrypted) persistent objects

    >>> users['stephan'].__parent__ = users
    >>> users['mgedmin'].__parent__ = users

    >>> users['stephan'].friend = users['mgedmin']
    >>> users['mgedmin'].friend = users['stephan']

Now let's create a database:

    >>> import ZODB.DB
    >>> import ZODB.MappingStorage
    >>> db = ZODB.DB(ZODB.MappingStorage.MappingStorage())
    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> conn.root()['users'] = users
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

And we can open a second connection (while carefully keeping the first one
open, to ensure it's not reused and we actually load the pickles rather than
receiving persistent objects from a cache) and load the whole object graph

    >>> conn2 = db.open()
    >>> users2 = conn2.root()['users']
    >>> users2['stephan']
    <UserPrivateData Stephan Richter 123456789>
    >>> users2['mgedmin']
    <UserPrivateData Marius Gedminas 987654321>

All the object references between persistent and encrypted persistent objects
are preserved correctly:

    >>> users2['stephan'].friend
    <UserPrivateData Marius Gedminas 987654321>
    >>> users2['mgedmin'].friend
    <UserPrivateData Stephan Richter 123456789>

    >>> users2['stephan'].__parent__ is users2
    True
    >>> users2['mgedmin'].__parent__ is users2
    True
    >>> users2['stephan'].friend is users2['mgedmin']
    True
    >>> users2['mgedmin'].friend is users2['stephan']
    True


Data conversion
---------------

If you used to have simple persistent objects, and now want to convert them
to `EncryptedPersistent`, think again.  This is not secure.  You already have
unencrypted bits on your disk platters, and the only way to get rid of them
is to physically destroy the disk.

But if you have a testing-only database with fake data, and would like to
continue using it with a small conversion step, you can use the
``convert_object_to_encrypted()`` function.

    >>> from keas.kmi.persistent import convert_object_to_encrypted

Here's the old class definition that we'll store:

    >>> from persistent import Persistent
    >>> class Password(Persistent):
    ...     def __init__(self, password):
    ...         self.password = password

    >>> db = ZODB.DB(ZODB.MappingStorage.MappingStorage())
    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> conn.root()['pwd'] = Password('xyzzy')
    >>> transaction.commit()

And now we redefine the class:

    >>> class Password(EncryptedPersistent):
    ...     def __init__(self, password):
    ...         self.password = password

Once again we have to use a different connection object (while keeping the
first one alive) to avoid stepping on a ZODB cache:

    >>> conn2 = db.open()
    >>> pwd = conn2.root()['pwd']

If you try to use `Password` objects loaded from the database, you'll get an
error:

    >>> pwd.password
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)

But we can apply the conversion step:

    >>> convert_object_to_encrypted(pwd)
    >>> pwd.password
    'xyzzy'

The converted state is stored in the DB

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> conn3 = db.open()
    >>> pwd = conn3.root()['pwd']
    >>> pwd.password
    'xyzzy'
